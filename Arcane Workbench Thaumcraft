SO I just breated my first Arcane Workbench following the questline.  I has Harvest level: Iron{3}.  The problem is no tool can actually harvest it.  I have a Tinkers pickaxe with Manyullyn mining level and it doesn;t work.  I tried a vanilla iron pickaxe, didn't work.  This Workbench is in a very bad spot in my base and I can't find a way to remove it.  Please Help!  Side note:  Only way I found to move it is with a vanilla Piston, just shoving it one block at a time.
